# Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array of N elements of positive values, transform this array such that every element in the array will consist of the product of every other element in the array except for it's original value without using division.

# Example:
array[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

transformed_array[5] = { 120, 60, 40, 30, 24 };
